# PowerBI-Dashboard

I took this london_weather.csv dataset from kaggle which contains over 4 decades of weather data in the city of london. I used this data to create a PowerBI dashboard in which you can tell the Average Temp, Avg Temp High, Avg Temp Low, of each day with in a range. This range also dictates the three other graphs. One which displays the average amount of percipitation in millimeters per day in a certain year. The same apply for the other two graphs. One graph is sunshine coverage and the other is cloud coverage, both of which display the average amount of their data per day, in a year/range. Amount many other things I used my expertize in PowerBI to sharpen up and make this dashboard look professional, clean, useful, and functional.

* I was not able to upload the .pbix/.pbit/.pbip file due to powerBI requiring a student or work email to publish it and my psu.edu email not allowing me to that publishing feature. I have upload a pdf/screenshot of my dashboard.
